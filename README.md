### About Restrictions

This application comes with a few built in restrictions:

1. A person may not sit at the same table more than once in a row,
2. A person may not sit at the same table more than *n* times overall,
3. And, of course, if the table is full, no more people may be seated. (This restriction may *not* be modified or removed.)

You may also create your own restrictions for situations that you need may need more control over. A few examples include...

- Prevent people who do not get along from being seated together.
- Prevent siblings from being assigned to the same table.
- In a situation where you have a group of people that speak one common language, but two or more of them speak another language, as well. You happen to know that the multilingual people are more comfortable speaking in the second language, even though it means excluding some of the people in the group. A restriction like this could prevent such a situation.
